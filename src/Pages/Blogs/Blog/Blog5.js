        <p className={props.paragraph}>
          Completing your syllabus one day before an exam may seem like a
          daunting task, but it is certainly possible with the right approach
          and mindset. Here are some tips to help you complete your syllabus and
          be fully prepared for your exam.
        </p>

        <p className={props.h2}>Create a study plan</p>

        <p className={props.paragraph}>
          Before you begin studying, it is important to create a study plan.
          Make a list of all the topics you need to cover and divide them into
          manageable chunks based on their importance and difficulty level.
          Allocate specific time slots for each topic and stick to the schedule.
          This will help you stay focused and motivated throughout the day.{" "}
        </p>

        <p className={props.h2}>Prioritize important topics</p>

        <p className={props.paragraph}>
          While creating your study plan, prioritize the important topics that
          are more likely to be covered in the exam. Focus on the topics that
          carry more weightage or have been emphasized by your teacher. This
          will help you make the most of your time and maximize your chances of
          scoring well in the exam.{" "}
        </p>

        <p className={props.h2}>Use study aids</p>

        <p className={props.paragraph}>
          To make the most of your limited time, use study aids such as summary
          notes, flashcards, and past papers. These resources can help you
          quickly revise important concepts and identify areas where you need to
          focus more. They can also help you test your knowledge and practice
          answering exam-style questions.{" "}
        </p>

        <p className={props.h2}>Take short breaks</p>

        <p className={props.paragraph}>
          Taking short breaks in between your study sessions can help you stay
          fresh and alert. Use this time to stretch, take a walk or have a
          healthy snack. Avoid distractions such as social media or phone calls
          during your breaks as they can waste your valuable time.
        </p>

        <p className={props.h2}>Focus on understanding, not memorizing</p>

        <p className={props.paragraph}>
          Instead of trying to memorize everything, focus on understanding the
          concepts and principles behind them. This will help you apply your
          knowledge to different scenarios and answer exam questions more
          effectively. Use real-life examples and analogies to make the concepts
          easier to understand and remember.
        </p>

        <p className={props.h2}>Stay positive</p>

        <p className={props.paragraph}>
          It is important to stay positive and confident throughout the day.
          Avoid negative thoughts and self-doubt as they can affect your
          performance. Believe in yourself and your abilities and remember that
          you have prepared well for the exam.
        </p>

        <p className={props.h2}>Get a good night's sleep</p>

        <p className={props.paragraph}>
          Finally, ensure that you get a good night's sleep before the exam.
          Sleeping well can help you consolidate your learning and improve your
          memory retention. It can also help you feel more refreshed and alert
          on the day of the exam.
        </p>
        <p className={props.h1}>Conclusion</p>
        <p className={props.paragraph}>
          In conclusion, completing your syllabus one day before an exam may
          seem challenging, but it is possible with the right approach and
          mindset. By creating a study plan, prioritizing important topics,
          using study aids, taking short breaks, focusing on understanding,
          staying positive, and getting a good night's sleep, you can maximize
          your chances of success in the exam. Remember to stay calm and
          focused, and trust yourself to perform to the best of your abilities.
